            An 'extremely credible source' has called my office and told me that Lorem Ipsum's birth certificate is a fraud. All of the words in Lorem Ipsum have flirted with me - consciously or unconsciously. That's to be expected. I think the only difference between me and the other placeholder text is that Iâ€™m more honest and my words are more beautiful.

            I have a 10 year old son. He has words. He is so good with these words it's unbelievable. Look at these words. Are they small words? And he referred to my words - if they're small, something else must be small. I guarantee you there's no problem, I guarantee.
